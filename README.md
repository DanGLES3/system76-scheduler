# System76 Scheduler

System service which automatically configures Linux's CPU scheduler for increased desktop responsiveness when on AC power, and reduces to default latencies on battery. The DBus interface provides methods for manually overriding the automatic scheduler to specify a default or responsive profile.

## CPU Scheduler Latency Configurations

### Default

The default settings for CFS by the Linux kernel. Achieves a high level of throughput for CPU-bound tasks at the cost of increased latency for inputs. This setting is ideal for servers and laptops on battery, because low-latency scheduling sacrifices some energy efficiency for improved responsiveness.

```yaml
latency: 6ns
minimum_granularity: 0.75ms
wakeup_granularity: 1.0ms
cpu_migration_cost: 0.5ms
bandwidth_size: 5us
```

### Responsive

Slightly reduces time given to CPU-bound tasks to give more time to other processes, particularly those awaiting and responding to user inputs. This can significantly improve desktop responsiveness for a slight penalty in throughput on CPU-bound tasks.

```yaml
latency: 4ns
minimum_granularity: 0.4ms
wakeup_granularity: 0.5ms
cpu_migration_cost: 0.25ms
bandwidth_size: 3us
```
